DON NOT !!! build files from here
go into dir below  for the os you are on and run the build from there

i.e. cd Linux 
cmake ../../ [this will create a makefile in the Linux dir]
make [to build project]
make package [to build an rpm or .deb]
etc.

i.e. cd Win
wincmakelist.bat 
nmake [to build project]
nmake package [to build an rpm or .deb]
etc.


You can get Release adn Debug install seperated by creating a Release and Debug dir and set the appropriate build type such as 

cmake ../../-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [in the release dir]
and likewise in the Debug dir
